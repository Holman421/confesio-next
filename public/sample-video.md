# Video File Placeholder

This is a placeholder for the video file. To use the Video Data Visualizer:

1. Add your video file here as `sample-video.mp4`
2. Or update the `videoSrc` prop in the VideoPlayer component to point to your video file

The application will generate mock data synchronized with the video timeline regardless of the actual video content.
